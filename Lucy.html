   <h1>Welcome to Lucy's Blog!</h1>
   <p>Hi there! My name is Lucy and I'm a 2 year old Golden Retriever. This page is for everyone to see what I'm up to since we all have to physically distance ourselves for a bit. In addition to all of the photos that my mom takes of me, I'll tell you a bit about myself.</p>
   <h2>My hobbies include, but are not limited to:</h2>
   <ul>
     <li>Swimming at Cannon Beach</li>
     <li>Sunbathing at the park</li>
     <li>Barking at squirrels</li>
     <li>Cuddling with my people</li>
